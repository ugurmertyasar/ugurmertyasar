### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Umy, a Behavioral Science PhD student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
My behavioral science research can be grouped into two goals: 

Mapping out cultural variation exhibited by people living under different institutional structures
- Finding out how efficiently anti-poverty policies affect populations with different cultures
- By bringing in insights from cultural psychology, he aims to inform the better design of tailored anti-poverty policies.

I am currently working with Dr. Thomas Talhelm, Dr. Anuj Shah and Dr. Josh Dean.
